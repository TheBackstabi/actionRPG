        <name>Shadowblade</name>

        bladed weapon strikes that leave their targets crippled and broken... if alive at all. They manipulate
        the shadows to hide their assaults and enhance their movement, weaving between enemy attacks as if they

        <name>Warlock</name>
        <description>Warlocks are adept summoners and magicians, able to manipulate the latent energy within
        themselves and the world around them. While some Warlocks prefer the powerful control and destructive
        force of Soul-powered spells, some prefer the darker and more corrosive Blood spells, slowly rotting
        away their foes with diseases and directly draining their vitality.</description>
